# Sailowtech-CTD - Low-Tech CTD Probe
Welcome on the repository of the Sailowtech CTD Project, an affordable and open-source CTD probe tailored for scientific expeditions.

## Why does this project exist?
After all, Open Source CTD probes already exist? Indeed, there are some great projects like [Open CTD](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD "Open CTD Project") or [CTDizzle](https://github.com/IanTBlack/CTDizzle/tree/main "CTDizzle Project"), but we wanted something more tailored for mid to long term expeditions while allowing a modularity in the embedded sensors. Therefore, we aim to develop a project around a main electronic core and auxiliary cards that can be swapped depending on the research interest. For the moment, we propose a core based on a Raspberry PI Zero 2 W and an auxiliary cards for 2 Atlas Scientific Sensors (Conductivity, Temperature, Dissolved Oxygen, pH...).

## Issues
If you encounter any issues, please use the Issue tracker on GitHub. Please note that this project is still in the development phase and currently undergoing testing.
