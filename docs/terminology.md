# Terminology

This page outlines the basic terminology used in this project.


## Metric

A **metric** is a type of measurement.
For example, *Temperature*, *Pressure* and other such things.

## Measurement

A **measurement** is a datapoint with the value of a *metric* which was measured at a specific time.

## Sensor

A **sensor** is a physical device which is installed on the CTD. It takes measurements of metrics. 

## Correlation Data

**Correlation Data** can be used to add additional measurements to the recorded data. This is mostly the case to add location and speed data, since the CTD is not tracking the location.
